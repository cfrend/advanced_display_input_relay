# advanced_display_input_relay
This is code that bridges custom input device commands to advanced display systems. An example would be the foot-switch created in spring of 2022 by Chauncey Frend for the IQ-Portal at Indiana University's Advanced Visualization Lab. Any custom input device could be built and integrated using this repo by a skilled ITPro.
